  Over the summer I stayed inside due to covid. During this time I worked on my book, some programming mini-projects that I found, and played video games. I also worked out, but again, that was mostly inside due to a global pandemic and stuff. Oh and I moved. That was fun.

This summer I stayed inside due to the pandemic. I passed the time by playing video games, watching movies, and programming. Wow what a great summer. 

This is fun. This is so much fun
