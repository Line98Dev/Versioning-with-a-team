Over the summer I spent a lot of time on Morse Reservoir with my family and friends. There was not much to do
over the summer due to COVID, but the reservoir was always open. I spent a majority of my time working at my
part time job to save up for the school year. I also spent time looking for internships for the fall semester
as well as full time jobs for when I graduate next semester. This included keeping up with my programming skills
and refining my resume.

  Over the summer I stayed inside due to covid. During this time I worked on my book, some programming mini-projects that I found, and played video games. I also worked out, but again, that was mostly inside due to a global pandemic and stuff. Oh and I moved. That was fun.

  What I did over the summer was build a computer and do an internship. The internship was good because I was able to learn Java Server Pages. However, I didn't really get to use much of it because of time and the company had me working on other projects. The other part of summer was building a computer. This computer was the first computer that I have ever built. I am happy to say that nothing went wrong with the build and is working perfectly.

This summer I stayed inside due to the pandemic. I passed the time by playing video games, watching movies, and programming. Wow what a great summer.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
